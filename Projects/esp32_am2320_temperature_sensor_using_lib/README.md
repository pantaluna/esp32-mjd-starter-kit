## Project Description

This project demonstrates the basics of using the MJD component "mjd_am2320" for the Aosong AM2320 temperature sensor.

Use it to get insights in how to use this component.

Goto the component "components/mjd_am2320" for installation and usage/wiring instructions, data sheets, FAQ, photo's, etc. for the hardware and software.

## Running the example
- Run `make menuconfig` and modify for example the GPIO PIN# that you want to use.
- Run `make flash monitor` to build and upload the example to your board and connect to its serial terminal.



## Reference: the ESP32 MJD Starter Kit SDK

Do you also want to create innovative IoT projects that use the ESP32 chip, or ESP32-based modules, of the popular company Espressif? Well, I did and still do. And I hope you do too.

The objective of this well documented Starter Kit is to accelerate the development of your IoT projects for ESP32 hardware using the ESP-IDF framework from Espressif and get inspired what kind of apps you can build for ESP32 using various hardware modules.
